# Notes

## 0.0.2
This version introduced:
* Normal calculations to check if the third point would be overlapping another point
* Using 3rd edge such that it will continue to trace the point cloud instead of getting caught on a point
* Proof of working calculations:
* ![NormalCalculationWorking](./Working_Proof.png)

* requirements.txt added (Only numpy is needed so it isn't that helpful).

## 0.0.1
Starting with the creation of this notes file I am recording the version number of the project. This will be the first version of the project as I haven't recorded numbers previously.

This version introduced:
* ![overlapping points](./overlapping.png)

From the previous version where we had:
* ![triangle](./triangle.png)
